# Trie Data Structure

Current features include adding words, finding all words of given prefix, and finding most used words with given prefix. <br/><br/>

The main runner file is the UserInputTrieTest file. <br/><br/>

To add words to the Trie, run the program and type words into the console and press enter. Words separated by a space will <br/>
be added as separate words. There are certain special commands that won't add words to the Trie. These include:<br/><br/>

**-.end**<br/>
  ends the program<br/>
**-.print** ** <br/>
  inserting a word where the asterisks are will print all the words beginning with that string <br/>
  can put -a instead of a word to print all words <br/>
**-.most** ** <br/>
  inserting a word where the asterisks are will print the most used word with that prefix <br/>
  can put -a instead of a word to get the most used word overall <br/>
**-.ifile** ** <br/>
  inserting a file name where the asterisks are will add all the words in that file (I think it only works with .txt files)' <br/>
  make sure your file is in the appriopriate location or it will not work <br/>
  
***It's important to preface your commands with -. in order for them to work*** <br/>
***Note that -.print and -.most command only work when there are two input words in the specified format*** <br/>
 <br/> 
This is a work in progress so expect bugs. I'm TRIEing my best. Haha, get it? Because it's like the word try, ha ha ha...  <br/> <br/>

Thank you! :D
