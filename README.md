# Trie Data Structure

Current features include adding words, finding all words of given prefix, and finding most used words with given prefix.

The main runner file is the UserInputTrieTest file.

To add words to the Trie, run the program and type words into the console and press enter. Words separated by a space will
be added as separate words. There are certain special commands that won't add words to the Trie. These include:

**-.end**
  ends the program
**-.print** **
  inserting a word where the asterisks are will print all the words beginning with that string
  can put -a instead of a word to print all words
**-.most** **
  inserting a word where the asterisks are will print the most used word with that prefix
  can put -a instead of a word to get the most used word overall
**-.ifile** **
  inserting a file name where the asterisks are will add all the words in that file (I think it only works with .txt files)'
  make sure your file is in the appriopriate location or it will not work
  
***It's important to preface your commands with -. in order for them to work***
***Note that -.print and -.most command only work when there are two input words in the specified format***

This is a work in progress so expect bugs. 

Thank you! :D
